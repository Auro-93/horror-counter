## Overview

### The concept

The creative idea behind this project was to transform a simple counter into a basic horror game.

The user can increment and decrement the counter within a range of integers from 1 to 17.

The computer generates a random number between 1 and 34.
If the computer generated number falls within the range of the counter, the user can win and "break free from the curse". If not, the game over screen will appear.

### The challenge

The challenge was to develop a simple counter with vanilla Javascript using the DOM manipulation features.
